# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed
I'm a Junior Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in fraud detection, computer vision, and predictive analytics.
I build end-to-end ML pipelines that focus on real-world impact, especially imbalanced problems, model evaluation, and decision-making.
My work emphasizes clean data pipelines, reproducibility, and production-ready workflows, not just notebooks.
