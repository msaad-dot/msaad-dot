# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed
I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience in fraud detection,
computer vision, and predictive analytics.

I build end-to-end ML pipelines focused on real-world impact, especially
imbalanced classification, probability-based evaluation, and business-driven
model selection.

## 🛠 Core Skills
- Machine Learning: Classification, Imbalanced Learning, Threshold Optimization, Model Evaluation (PR-AUC)
- Models: XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- Deep Learning: CNNs (TensorFlow / Keras)
- Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy, Feature Engineering
- Computer Vision: OpenCV
- Tools: Python, Git, GitHub, Jupyter


## 📌 Featured Projects

### 1️⃣ Credit Card Fraud Detection
- End-to-end ML pipeline for highly imbalanced fraud detection (≈0.17% fraud rate)
- Evaluated Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost using PR-AUC
- Performed model-specific threshold tuning to balance fraud recall and false positives
- Reduced false positive alerts by approximately 94 percent while maintaining ~86 percent fraud recall, leading to a significantly lower expected operational cost
- Selected XGBoost as the final model using cost-based evaluation and expected financial loss analysis
- Included production-ready inference module with config-driven decision logic and API-ready design.
